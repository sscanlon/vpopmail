------------------------------------------------------------
If you are running a recent version of vpopmail you should be able to:
 perl Makefile.PL (may need to be root)
 make (may need to be root)
 make test (as root or vpopmail user)
 [ su root | sudo ] make install


------------------------------------------------------------
if Makefile.PL fails (and its not a permissions issue):
1.
	Edit Makefile.attic: set include paths
	edit the 'LIBS' and 'INC' lines to point to your vpopmail install.
	If you are using vpopmail with mysql
	you *may* need to add the mysqlclient library as well as libz (-lz)
	to the 'LIBS' section of Makefile.PL.
	e.g: 
'LIBS'      => ['-L/home/vpopmail/lib -lvpopmail -L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient']

2.
	perl Makefile.attic

3.
	make
4.
	make test (as root or vpopmail user)
5.
	[ su root | sudo ] make install
